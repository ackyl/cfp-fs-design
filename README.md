# 🤔 Philosophy

- ## ~~Gatsby~~ Next
  - In terms of overall benefit, Next and Gatsby is pretty similar.
  - Next has no opinion towards how we should do our data fetching. So in case we need to do some backend in the future, we are not locked to use GraphQL.
  - In terms of popularity, Next wins. Therefore, a lot of resource covers them online.
  - FS Web Engineers used Next to build merchant platform. We can ask them if we find any difficulties regarding Next.
- ## ~~Javascript~~ Typescript
  - In order to make CFP runs good in the long run, there's no denying that Typescript is really important. Over long periods of time, a web that is build on top of javascript become unreadable and will trap us in debugging hell.
  - For speed, all we need to do is to familiarize ourselves with Typescript. I could say that after understanding it, Typescript is way faster.
- ## ~~CSS~~ SCSS
  - Nesting class is convinient.
- ## ~~React Context~~ Jotai
  - Typescript oriented.
  - Simpler in integration and implementation.
